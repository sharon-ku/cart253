/**************************************************
Activity 8: Sound activity
Sharon Ku

Letâ€™s make a simple musical toy!

The canvas will start blank and the user can add moving circles by clicking. As a circle moves it will emit a tone based on its distance from the centre of the canvas. When a circle touches the edges of the canvas it will bounce, and play a note!

The result will hopefully be a kind of musical instrument based on some basic physics programming and an example of how we can use procedural sound creatively.

// array that stores balls

  for (let i = 0; i < balls.length; i++) {
    let ball = balls[i];
    ball.bounce();
    ball.move();
    ball.display();
